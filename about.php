  <p>Chris Rhodes is the self-proclaimed silverball sultan of wedgehead, bringing in a few dozen of his favorite
    games to light up the unique gameroom. With well over a hundred games in his personal collection, Rhodes will
    be
    curating the best from the 1960s-today and keeping them playing slick and fast. He has been an operator in
    Portland for over a decade and an avid tournament player/organizer for at least two decades. He's the pinball
    pusher-man. Just try to leave without a new and worsening habit.</p>
  <p>Alan Robertson is the mastermind of the food program at Wedgehead. He's a 16 year industry professional, with
    experience in all cuisines from fine dining to fast casual. His approach is to deliver inspired bar food, all
    scratch made in house. Food that youâ€™ll find yourself craving. No trends here. Just the common - overly
    engineered to be uncommonly great. His previous stints in portland included Clyde Common and as the chef of
    Bunk
    Sandwiches.</p>
