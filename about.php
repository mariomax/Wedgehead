  <p class="p1">Chris Rhodes is the self-proclaimed silverball sultan of wedgehead, bringing in a few dozen of his favorite games to light up the unique gameroom. With well over a hundred games in his personal collection, Rhodes will be curating the best from the 1960s-today and keeping them playing slick and fast. He has been an operator in Portland for over a decade and an avid tournament player/organizer for at least two decades. He's the pinball pusher-man. Just try to leave without a new and worsening habit.</p>
  <p class="p2">Alan Robertson is the mastermind of the food program at Wedgehead. He's a 16-year industry professional, with experience in all cuisines from fine dining to fast casual. His approach is to deliver inspired bar food, all scratch made in house. Food that youâ€™ll find yourself craving. No trends here. Just the common - overly engineered to be uncommonly great. His previous stints in portland included Clyde Common and as the chef of Bunk Sandwiches.</p>
