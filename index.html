    <h3>We are the premier pinball arcade in Portland. Serving bad-ass bar food, stiff drinks and cold beer, and home to 25 rotating pins from all eras.</h3>
    <p>Join us for all Blazer games with food and drink specials.</p>
    <p>Chris Rhodes is the self-proclaimed silverball sultan of wedgehead, bringing in a few dozen of his favorite games to light up the unique gameroom. With well over a hundred games in his personal collection, Rhodes will be curating the best from the 1960s-today and keeping them playing slick and fast. He has been an operator in Portland for over a decade and an avid tournament player/organizer for at least two decades. He's the pinball pusher-man. Just try to leave without a new and worsening habit.</p>
    <p>Alan Robertson is the mastermind of the food program at Wedgehead. He's a 16 year industry professional, with experience in all cuisines from fine dining to fast casual. His approach is to deliver inspired bar food, all scratch made in house. Food that youâ€™ll find yourself craving. No trends here. Just the common - overly engineered to be uncommonly great. His previous stints in portland included Clyde Common and as the chef of Bunk Sandwiches.</p>
    <p>Menu specials will change weekly, but please check out our sample menu page for a peek at some of our tasty creations.</p>
